# Interview-Cell
Set of Placement-driven coding questions done in multiple programming languages; Java,C++,C,Python and so on. This is a 3 Phase program each consisting of 10 levels under which there a number of questions solved. 

## Instructions 
- C/C++
  - Install [TCC-MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler for executing and compiling C and C++ files.
  - Set the path to the bin of TCC by going to *Environment variables* and adding a new path.
  - Open command line and run the commands `gcc -o outputfile filename.c` and `outputfilename.exe` for C.
  - Respectively for C++, `g++ -o outputfile filename.cpp` and `outputfilename.exe`. _This is for compilation and execution._
- Java 
  - Install the latest [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) and set path to bin.
  
  - _**Disclaimer: JDK 11 cannot be used for professional use. Stick with JDK 8 for avoiding your application from getting stripped down.**_
  - Setting path is easy as this - `C:\Guru> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\bin`. _Run this in cmd._
  - Open command line and run `C:\Guru> javac HelloTesters.java` and `C:\Guru> java HelloTesters`.
- Python 
  - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for _Windows._
  - Set the path and enter `python` in cmd to enter the python shell.
  - To execute a script file run `python filename.py`.
